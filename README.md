# tale

## Welcome to tale - tail rewritten in Rust.

### tale is designed to be fast, simple, and secure

## Usage:
```
tale <yourfile> <options>
```
### Like tail - tale will output the last 10 lines of your file(s) by default. Some options to consider are: 
`-n #` where `#` selects the number of lines from line `#`-eof in `<yourfile>`

`-c #` where `#` selects the number of characters from char `#`-eof in `<yourfile>`
